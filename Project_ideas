Project Idea 1: 
Fake News detection

Abstract:
Many times we see fake news being circulated on social media websites which provides misleading information to people. Having a system that can detect unauthentic news would be helpful in this case.

Summary:
This project aims at using machine learning algorithms to detect such fake news. This would provide a result based on keywords search, URL/source credibility etc.
Here is how it would work:
1. User posts the suspected URL/content to the proposed system.
2. The system applies AI and machine learning algorithms to detect the authenticity of news.
3. The system tells the user if the news is authentic or not along with confidence score. The system also provides the shreds of evidences and references to the articles taken into consideration while calculating the result. 


Project Idea 2: 
Spartan Project Reviewer 

Abstract: 
In many of our university classes, we are required to work on projects. We often have to come up with our own projects ideas that will require the approval of the professor or TA. This can be a difficult process because there is not a really good way to submit your project ideas for the professor or TA to review. 

Summary:
This will be a Web Application where students and professors can create and review projects to work on.
How will it work:
The professor starts by creating a workspace for the class e.g. cmpe-272-fall-2018. 
In this workspace, the professor adds a pool of optional projects ideas that students/teams can pick as their project. 
Students or/and teams create a sub-workspace with their team name e.g. Team-5.
Students can start adding project ideas to their team workspace. They can use a template form to keep each project idea organized. 
Students can mark project ideas as completed and when the professor or TA logs in to the application they can start reviewing the completed project ideas. 
Professor or TA can approve, deny, suggest improvement, etc. to each project idea. An email notification is sent to project members when the professors performs any action to their project ideas.
Other students can see the ideas from different teams and they can do a thumbs up if they think the idea is very interesting. 
If a team has many very good project ideas, this team can allow other teams to pick any of their left over project ideas. 


Project Idea 3:  
Recommendation Engine for trending topics according to interests

Abstract:
As software engineers, we are expected to keep abreast of new topics and technologies. However, it is difficult to keep up with these while trying to tackle existing problems at the same time. It would be helpful to have a tool to help us do this in less time on a regular basis.

Summary:
This would be a recommendation engine that would allow you to search for a term and return related trending topics based on popularity which you could then investigate further. Here is how it would work:

User opens the web portal and is immediately presented with a search box that allows them to enter a term
(Optional) The user can log in to review updated results for past search terms.
The recommender will attempt to find commonalities between the search term and new/trending terms
The page will present the results with the trend statistics
(Optional) The page will present helper links to Wikipedia / etc for further research
(Optional) A logged in user could choose to “watch” a topic and receive periodic updates.

Ways that data could be produced:
Gathering data from Wikipedia based on hyperlinks located on the pages, and calculating “distance” between pages, prioritizing pages with higher page counts
Trending hashtags or existing Twitter follow lists
Popular new Github projects leveraging known libraries
A combination of the above or other methods
